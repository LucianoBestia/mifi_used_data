*Things are changing fast. This is the situation on 2020-03-27.*  
Read the data from the wifi status page and saves it in a database.  
Then show the use in a graph.  
The url for the status:  
<http://192.168.225.1/cgi-bin/en-jio/mStatus.html>  
The part of the xhtml, that is insteresting:  

```html
<strong id="pSentPackets">UL:</strong><br>
<label id="lsentPackets">258.55 MB</label><br><br>
<strong id="pRecPackets">DL:</strong><br>
<label id="lRecPackets">1.17 GB</label>
```

what database should I use?  
Something simple?
